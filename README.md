This repository will contain the experiments (and maybe some of the research) that
I made during the MC942 course at Unicamp.  
Experiment 1 was about simulating a backdoor on a VM and running a program on it.  
Experiment 2 (currently under 'rushed' development) is about assembling a dictionary
whilst exploring a file hierarchy (is being done recursively and using dirent.h).
